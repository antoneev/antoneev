## Alittle about me :smiley:
I'm a Computer Science master's candidate along with a Programmer Analyst Intern for Teachers' Retirement Systems of Illinois.  I’m currently doing research using Big Data Analytics tools on COVID-19; in addition, I’m working on my thesis which uses Natural Language Processing. I’ve found a passion for Data Science and I’m continuously building my knowledge in the field. In addition, I own a tech and branding business with a friend – TAB Innovations.
